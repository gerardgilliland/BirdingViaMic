# BirdingViaMic
Birding Via Mic is an android app that identifies birds by their songs. Technically it doesn't differentiate between songs and calls. You can record a bird singing, play the song back, edit the recording, and (hopefully) identify the bird. 
This app has three main areas: 1) Database management which allows you to modify, edit and maintain your bird list, 2) Identifying birds from your recordings (given enough data), 3) The songs supplied with this app.
